considering a block of metal having dimensions L,W and h.and n is the charge per unit volume.
we need to calculate current I_R and the voltage is V_R,across the length of metal.so the current is 


$$ I_R = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = Q_s \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = Q_s \cdot V_d $$

or we can also write it as

$$ I_r = \text{Sheetcharge} \times \text{avg velocity} $$


where Qs = n*w*h is sheetcharge or charge per unit length


and Vd=average velocity 

$$ V_d = \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \mu \cdot E $$

$$ E = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} $$ and \mu is the mobility of the material

therefore 



\[ IR = \mu \cdot Q_s \cdot \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \]


the incremental resistance can be expressed



\[ \Delta R = \frac{\Delta v}{IR} = \frac{\rho \cdot \Delta x}{W \cdot h} \]


where rho is the specific resistvity which is the proprty of materiall that can be defined as the resistance per unit volume which is expressed as ohm meter but oftern used as ohmcm.

the total resistance of the volume can be founded by 



\[ R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A} \]


where 


\[ \frac{\rho}{h} \]


is the sheet-rho

the specific resistance in ohm cm and unit resistance
