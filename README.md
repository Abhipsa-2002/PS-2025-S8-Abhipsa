considering a block of metal having dimensions L,W and h.and n is the charge per unit volume.
we need to calculate current I_R and the voltage is V_R,across the length of metal.so the current is 


$$ I_R = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = Q_s \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = Q_s \cdot V_d $$

or we can also write it as

$$ I_r = \text{Sheetcharge} \times \text{avg velocity} $$


where Qs = n*w*h is sheetcharge or charge per unit length


and Vd=average velocity 

$$ V_d = \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \mu \cdot E $$

$$ E = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} $$ and \mu is the mobility of the material
